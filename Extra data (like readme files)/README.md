# Precipitation_Data_For_Wedding
Going to use multiple ML models to predict the precipitation data for a wedding between April 2023 and September 2023.

I am going to have multiple ML models for this repository, including a Tensorflow model. THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

This was built using Python 3.9.7



We have decided on a date for the wedding, September 16th 2023. This project is not much use now, therefore I will not be doing
a Tensorflow model for it. I will get a new data set to build the models that I was not able to in this data.
